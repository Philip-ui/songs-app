1) Intro about the project.

This project is about an app for a Vocal Learning Tracker. There's a login 
        and logout authentication and menu using react router. It can create, update, and delete
        individual lessons, that is 'Add Songs': A song title and lyrics of the song can be added, a 
        timer to see how long the practice takes, and a check box whether it is completed or not. 
        It has a, 'Schedule': for for vocal learning like tenor, soprano, bass and etc and the
        date and time for the practice and also a timer.

2) What is 1 challenge you face?
The challenge I face is creating 'Add Songs' card and 'Schedule' card. I can't 
use the same components, like TodoCard, AddTodo and etc. It won't work.

3) And how you resolve it or how you attempt to resolve it?
Create another TodoCard that is TodoScheduleA, as for AddTodo is AddSchedule,
and EditTodo is EditSchedule.

4) What you learnt from creating these projects?
I learnt to create, read, update and delete data in react js. Use bootstrap css
React router, Login and Logout and timer(useEffect).
